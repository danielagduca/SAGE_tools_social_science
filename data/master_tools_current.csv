Unipark,"Unipark is the academic program of Questback. Because we’re passionate about learning, we provide the world’s leading online survey software to universities and institutes at a significantly discounted rate And it’s been a huge success: since Unipark was founded in 2004, thousands of students and post-graduates from over 400 universities have completed their degree- and PHD theses using our software, and have built a foundation for their professional careers. Our EFS Survey software is the industry standard solution for online feedback and survey research. That means: at Unipark you’ll be working with the same software used by many large organizations, consultancies and market research institutes to complete their online studies.
This has two advantages. Firstly, you can be sure that you are completing your project with a truly excellent and proven software solution. Secondly, when you’re applying for jobs, many personnel managers will be very interested to read that you have experience using Questback software.",https://www.unipark.com/en/,200,,surveys,,Questback,,,,Germany,2004,Paid,,,,Scaling,Private,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLO0uJrR5E5IQOfk8uPi8oQoD3zGINHp-H&v=0fUMfcycA3I&feature=emb_title
