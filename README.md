# Acknowledgments

This paper would not have been possible without the work of Shulin Hu
and Lily Davies, both master's students within the Digital Humanities
programme at University College London, and Eve Kraicer, master's
student in Gender Studies at the London School of Economics, whose work
on this project involved data cleaning and looking at gender
distribution. We also want to thank all the researchers, developers, and
startup founders who endured and answered with patience and insight our
endless questions.
